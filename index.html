This is currently a work in progress, expect edits and refinements.
Currently (kinda) a first draft, in need of simplifying as much as possible,
perhaps some rearranging and certainly cutting down on repetition.
</p>

<p>
TODO
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Explain battle menus for the speed runners</li>
<li>Tidy and rearrange, kinda feels like a mess</li>

<p>
Fun fact: chocobo racing game, specifically the betting screen, has
its own double input like bug, that was <b><b>correctly</b></b> ported from PSX.

<b>Just putting this here for no apparent reason.</b>
</p>

<p>
Any and all questions/feedback is welcomed and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Corrections, clarifications and additions will be made thanks to them
so please do fire away. If something isnt clear its likely a failure
on my part.
</p>

<p>
This was put together with bad notes, 4+ month old memory and re
reversing the relevant parts. If I seem vague or uncertain at points,
it is because of bad notes, not wanting to 100% trust my memory and not
having the time to re read a metric s tone of assembly :D. Though I
should patch up uncertainties as time allows.
</p>

<p>
Because the scope of knowledge of the games code and computer science
concepts varies wildly from individual to individual in the speed
running community and modding/developing community, (the two audiences
I expect to be reading this,) I'll be doing my best to write in a way
that caters to people with low and high levels of knowledge at the
same time. I am not an expert but believe I can do decent job at
that. Sorry if it gets annoying.
</p>

<p>
This explanation of the input repeat feature will cover:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where it keeps track of timings and flags with regards to this input
repeat feature.</li>

<li>What can and cant repeat in each 'menu context' that is covered and
what a 'repeatable keys list' is.</li>

<li>When, where and how double input happens.</li>

<li>Where the fix is and why it's there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Effectively an if else statement, (read as "a fork in the road",)
where both paths "go to the same place", and the condition being
checked, (read as "which path to take",) always being true (read as
"only one path is ever taken"). I think I did a good job there
explaining that the piece of code in question is nonsense, whether
your are a layman or familiar with coding concepts. And the problems
with that code dont end there.

Throughout this tangled mess of red string on a wall you will find a
collection of reference and/or back links at the top/bottom of some
sections. It is to make navigation and reading easier. There is a lot
covered and it will be hard to follow without being able to look back
at sections and quickly return to where you left from.
</p>

<p>
'Reference links' will lead you back to sections that were already
covered and are referenced in the current section.
</p>

<p>
'Back links' will lead you back to sections that reference the current
section.
</p>

<p>
So before clicking a reference link, remember the name of the current
section. And when you are done click the corresponding back link to
return.

Most commonly perceived by people when pressing a direction followed
by Circle in a menu. The key is to press Circle immediately after
pressing the direction. And without releasing the direction.
</p>

<p>
For example, easily the most common way of experiencing it, Down &gt;
Circle.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enter the Main (Triangle) Menu.</li>
<li>The cursor is on <b>Item</b>.</li>
<li>Press and hold <b>Down</b> immediately followed by a press of <b>Circle</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What is expected is, the menu cursor goes down 1 place and Circle
confirms on <b>Magic</b> and enters that menu. As it does on PSX under the
same circumstances.
</p>

<p>
What happens is the down button is processed, and the Circle press
processes and additional 'down' before confirming on <b>Materia</b> and
entering that menu(if materia has been unlocked of course).
</p>

<p>
This is where the 'Double Input' name comes from, because a 2nd input
is being experienced.
</p>

<p>
The above steps can be repeated:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In any menu/submenu directions can repeat in.</li>
<li>With other buttons instead of <b>Circle</b>. Like <b>Square</b> or <b>R2</b> or
<b>Triangle</b> or etc.</li>
<li>With other directions (as long as they can repeat in that menu)
including <b>L1</b> and <b>R1</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<br />
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-Not%20just%20directions%20can%20be%20%27doubled%27" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Not%20just%20directions%20can%20be%20%27doubled%27">Not just directions can be 'doubled'</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Not%20just%20directions%20can%20be%20%27doubled%27">
<p>
<br />
These steps will demonstrate that the input repeat feature does not
act on buttons held in a previous menu/context. Not relevant to DI
really, but will help delineate where the next test will be. And
Illustrate that it is a repeatable input that is getting doubled.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enter the Triangle &gt; Item menu.</li>
<li>Select any item that can be used on one or all party members. A
potion for example.</li>
<li>The cursor is now over a party member.</li>
<li><b>Hold X</b>.</li>
<li>The cursor is now over the potion again, and there it remains.</li>
<li><b>Release X</b>.</li>
<li><b>Hold X</b>.</li>
<li>After 200ms you are in the triangle menu.</li>
<li>And there you remain.</li>
<li><b>Release X</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are now going to skip that 200ms. Well we wont, but it looks that
way, we actually reset it like the PSX version does when a new input
is pressed, only we will play a 'doubled' X at the same time.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Press circle.</li>
<li>The cursor is back in the Item menu, pointing at the first item in
the list.</li>
<li>Hold X <b>and before 200ms</b>, heck as quickly as possible press either
<b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> to skip the 200ms with a doubled input of X.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like with Down &gt; Circle the second button causes the first to be
processed a 2nd time.
</p>

<p>
The previous three steps can be repeated over and over replacing Up or
Down with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Square</li>
<li>R1 or L1</li>
<li>Left or Right</li>
<li>Triangle</li>
<li>Select</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those steps cannot be repeated in menu contexts where X is not a
button that can repeat.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Some%20fun">
<p>
<br />
A bonus bit of fun once the mind has been expanded by the above.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>In the Triangle menu</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This test expects the user to be holding a controller or be quick
enough at alternating pressing any two buttons&#x2026; or at least faster
that they are at mashing one button.
</p>

<p>
Square or L2 and R2 can be switched out for any inputs that feel
comfortable, and don't take effect on the menu.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Hold Down and mash Square as fast as you can.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
Whats happening?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>*Now hold Down (or Up, doesn't matter) and alternate L2 and R2 faster</li>
</ul>
<p>
than the Square mash.*
Whats happening?
</p>

<p>
That's not air you're breathing&#x2026;. i mean that's not down repeating,
that's down getting double-input'd.
</p>

<p>
Whats expected, like on PSX, is each press of a new button should
prevent Down from repeating, down should only move one place, and
remain there as long as the new buttons are being pressed.
</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />

<div id="outline-container-Testing%20with%20the%20mod" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Testing%20with%20the%20mod">
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
The mod can be used to increase the Input Repeat Rate. This can
facilitate testing for "doubled" inputs after 200ms has passed. Which
do happen, but are hard to perceive. Trying to spot an extra Down when
Down is being processed every 50 milliseconds without using tools is
bonkers.
</p>

<p>
Speed runners my find this last test illuminating as its been long
believed that double input is only present when pressing a button
shortly after pressing another. Rather than always possible as long as
a repeatable button is held within a menu.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Load the mod into 7th heaven.</li>
<li>Enable it and click on the configure button.</li>
<li>Leave the fix disabled.</li>
<li>Leave Delay at default.</li>
<li>Set Rate to Infinity.</li>
<li>Load the game.</li>
<li>Get to a menu of your choosing.</li>
<li>Hold down a repeatable button you would like to test for double
input.</li>
<li>It will process once, and then after 200ms a second time.</li>
<li>You are now in infinite rate. No other ticks of repeat will occur.</li>
<li>Press another button to see if it triggers a doubled input.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After reading below it will be obvious that rate is irrelevant, the
instant a button is pressed rate is over, and a new cycle of input
processing is underway.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Inputs%2C%20and%20their%20values">
<p>
<br />
Here we have the hex, binary and decimal representations of the games
values for buttons in the 'all held keys' and 'keys this frame'
variables, single inputs lists and repeatable inputs lists.
</p>

<p>
The binary being the most illuminating, showing how one variable can
hold and be checked for multiple inputs. These values take up no more
than 2 bytes and match up with how the PSX version of the game does
it.
</p>

<p>
I will be using the PSX's names for these buttons. This is the game
logic's representation of these buttons and on PC it does not matter
what keyboard keys, game pad buttons or dance mats these buttons are
bound to. This is what the game will see them as by the time it gets
to any of the code we are covering here.
</p>

<pre class="example">
| PC     | PSX      |  Hex |           Binary | Decimal |
|--------+----------+------+------------------+---------|
| Camera | L2       | 0001 | 0000000000000001 |       1 |

|        |          |      |                  |         |

| OK     | Circle   | 0020 | 0000000000100000 |      32 |
| Cancel | X        | 0040 | 0000000001000000 |      64 |
| Switch | Square   | 0080 | 0000000010000000 |     128 |
|        |          |      |                  |         |
| Assist | Select   | 0100 | 0000000100000000 |     256 |
| Start  | Start    | 0800 | 0000100000000000 |    2048 |
|        |          |      |                  |         |
| Up     | Up       | 1000 | 0001000000000000 |    4096 |
| Right  | Right    | 2000 | 0010000000000000 |    8192 |
| Down   | Down     | 4000 | 0100000000000000 |   16384 |
| Left   | Left     | 8000 | 1000000000000000 |   32768 |
</pre>

<p>
The values are stored in 2 bytes (16 bits), leaving 2 unused bits
between select and start. This doesn't mean there are some secret
hidden buttons, it just means they had room to spare.
</p>

<p>
So using the table above we can see that variables of 2 bytes in
length can denote the state of every button in the game, pressed = 1,
not pressed = 0. We need only watch for the buttons corresponding bit
from the binary column in the above table.
</p>

<p>
For example the corresponding bit for L2 is the 1 (or 0 if the button
is not pressed) the furthest to the right.
</p>

<pre class="example">
0000000000000001
               ^
</pre>

<p>
While the corresponding bit for R2 is one space to the left of that.
</p>

<pre class="example">
0000000000000010
              ^
</pre>
<p>
And so on and so forth for the rest of the buttons.
</p>

<p>
Because there is no bits overlapping, 2 bytes can hold the state of
every button in the game. Like so:
</p>

<p>
Psx's reset combination would look like this

I am going to lay out terms I have used or come up with while trying
to explain FF7's Input Repeat Feature and the Double Input glitch.
</p>

<p>
Fair warning, I tend to use keys and inputs interchangeably. I should
fix that at some point.
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT: <b>Menu</b>:<br />
Includes all menus in the game apart from those that are part of
minigames or are in dialogue boxes in fields.
</p>

<p>
<b>UDLR</b>:<br />
up, down, left, right.
</p>

<p>
<b>Input Repeat Feature</b>, <b>IRF</b>:<br />
A feature in FF7 PC and PSX that facilitates what many call auto fire,
rapid fire etc. It is experienced when in menus certain buttons are
held down and a moment later the game acts as though that button is
being pressed rapidly.
</p>

<p>
In each menu or submenu only certain keys/inputs can repeat. For
example Circle cannot repeat in the top level of Triangle/Main
menu. But can in battle menu. R1 and L1 cannot repeat in top level of
Triangle/Main menu. But can in many menus with lists, like the item
selection sub menu under the Triangle/Main menu &gt; Item Menu.
</p>

<p>
<b>Repeatable Keys List, RKL</b>:<br />
When a menu parses inputs it iterates over a hard coded list of keys
that can repeat in that menu, and checks whether each of those buttons
are in a down state. If they are and the repeat gate/flag is set. The
found keys are played in game. (with some exceptions #1)
</p>

<p>
<b>Double Input glitch</b>, <b>DI glitch</b>:<br />
A glitch that happens in FF7, on PC, in menus, when:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one or more buttons that can repeat in the current menu are in a
down/pressed state (not a up/released state) (<b>DI Initial Input</b>)</li>
<li>any other button/buttons is/are put into a down/pressed state (<b>DI
Trigger Input</b>) (yes more than one button can get pressed in the same
frame)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Causing all <b>Initial Inputs</b> to be processed by the game at the moment
the <b>Trigger Input</b> is pressed. Most commonly perceived when two buttons
are pressed in quick succession, giving the user the experience of a
"doubled input".

<p>
A flag that is set to 0 when:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E0 (keys this frame) holds a value greater than 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is set to 1 when the following are all true:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E0 holds no value (all 0's)</li>
<li>D4 (all held keys) holds a value greater than 0.</li>
<li>The timer is not less than 'current wait'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In English, this flag = 1 when these three things are true:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No buttons were pressed this frame</li>
<li>One or more buttons are still held this frame</li>
<li>Either 200ms has passed since the last button was pressed or 50ms
has passed since the last tick of repeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This flag, as written, is 1 when inputs should repeat. And 0 when only
keys pressed this frame should be processed.
</p>

<p>
<b>This flag is never read by the game at any point in time.</b>

</p>

<p>
Gets passed a key value in the stack and checks for it in the D4 "all
held keys" memory location by calling the 0041AB67 'in all keys'
function.
</p>

<p>
Returns a non zero value in the eax register if the button is found in
D4 and the repeat gate/flag is 1. If a non zero value is returned
the found key is played in game later (with some exceptions #1).
</p>

<p>
This function is the only method menus use to check for inputs from
keys that have the potential to repeat.
</p>

<p>
Used by menus to find repeatable keys and repeatable keys only. The
problem is there is no distinction made between the initial presses of
the repeatable keys and an already held key.
</p>

<p>
This function is called by a variety of what I call repeatable key
wrapper functions, that either have a list of repeatable keys that
suit the calling menu's context and are one at a time passed to this
function (099) or are themselves passed keys to pass onto this
function.
</p>

<p>
Whats more is the press of any button (with exceptions based on
context - <a href="#I%20mentioned%20an%20exceptions%20%232%20and%20never%20clarified">#2</a>) causes an already held key to get played in game, even
if that pressed key has no effect on that menu and no code to handle
or acknowledge it in that menu.
</p>

<p>
A press of any key causes this function to return all repeatable keys
that are in a down state down state as valid for processing.
Regardless of whether or not it is time to play held repeatable keys.
</p>

<p>
I describe this as, in menus, every input triggers a tick of input
repeat.
</p>

<p>
I cant be 100% sure whether this stems from fault or failure in the
writing of this function or some other part of the code before or
after each call of it. But I believe that this function is the cause
of double input and was likely where a proper implementation of
repeatable input parsing was being constructed.
</p>

<p>
But what I am sure of, is the fact that it, like other parts of the
code, has a nonsense about it. A nonsense that can be leveraged to
repair the bug. And that it is used for every menus processing of keys
that have the potential to repeat and so is a single place where a fix
can go that would mend all menus at once.

<p>
Called by menus or wrapper functions to check up, down, left or
right.
</p>

<p>
Does more than other smaller wrappers but all that matters for now is
that it returns a non zero value in eax if the key was found and is
valid for processing or another special case is met. And a zero if
not.
</p>

<p>
I have theory's and little time to test them. May be for the tutorial
sections as the code does seem to be overriding cases where no button
is found and setting them as found returning a 1 in eax. Not related
to DI as DI can occur on any key, not just UDLR. When time allows I'll
pull this thread.
</p>

<p>
Gets passed a key value in the stack and checks for it in the D4 "all
held keys" memory location by calling the 0041B099 function. (099).
</p>

<p>
If 099 returns with a non zero value in eax, this function returns
with a non zero value in eax. Specifically, a '00000001'.
</p>

<p>
If 099 returns with a 0 in eax, this function will return with a 0 in
eax unless a second value pulled from the stack does not match the key
value that was checked for.
</p>

<p>
Only keys that we dont find in 099 have the potential to get
overridden. Keys we do find will always result in eax returning a non
0 value.

</p>

<p>
This wrapper is used by many menus to find UDLR.
</p>

<p>
Laid out in this block of code is a list of directions that it checks
one at a time by pushing them into the stack and calling a wrapper
function.
</p>

<p>
The order of the checks for inputs in this wrapper is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>up</li>
<li>down</li>
<li>left</li>
<li>right</li>
<li>L1</li>
<li>R1</li>
</ul>

<p>
They can be seen every time there is a push followed by a call to
006F53B2 aka 3B2&#x2026; not to be confused with DB2, this function. Or
when there is a push followed by a call to 006F53F1 (aka 3F1) in the
case of R1 and L1.
</p>

<p>
BUT R1 and L1 often do not get reached. And are usually handled by the
menus main calling 3F1 directly.
</p>

<p>
This function is 433 lines/instructions long, small parts will be
shown for illustration purposes.
</p>

<p>
In order to save space they likely made this wrapper that's just for
directions and reused it where menus needed to process UDLR. Even if
not all keys mattered in that menu, like 'New Game / Continue?' where
left and right make no sense and don't take effect on that menu, but
still are processed and returned as valid by 099 (exceptions #1).
</p>

<p>
Whats important to take away from here is that eax is checked if it is
0 or non zero, and then processing of the input is queued/takes place
if its non zero.

This is a repeatable keys wrapper used for the save slot selection sub
menu of the first menu the player interacts with.
</p>

<p>
I will not be covering it here. This is long enough and nothing new
will be seen within it anyway. It is not used for saving, only
loading. And perhaps other places. All the buttons it checks for, it
does so with 3F1 (simple wrapper). The inputs it handles, in this
order, are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Up</li>
<li>Down</li>
<li>Left  (i know, wtf)(exceptions #1)</li>
<li>Right (i know, wtf)(exceptions #1)</li>

This has input processing logic for keys in the first menu that loads
(&#x2026;. kinda the second.. or third, but nevermind). Its where you
choose 'New Game' or 'Continue?'.
</p>

<p>
Not speaking authoritatively here on what is and isn't 'main'. It and
other functions like it are as high up the chain I need to go to have
all input parsing calls at the current functions level or in calls
below it. So for now that name suits me, ish.
</p>

<p>
This menu like others has sub menus, so a total of 3 menus are covered
by this code. They and the single inputs (buttons that don't repeat)
that they are coded to handle are as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New Game / Continue?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>only circle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save file selection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>circle and X</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save slot selection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>circle and X</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
This calls the repeatable keys logic for each menu, and uses the
0041AB74 (B74) (is key in recent list) function directly for all
single inputs that each menu can handle&#x2026; inputs that don't repeat.
</p>

<p>
The repeatable keys list, in order, for each menu are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New Game / Continue?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UDLR</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save file selection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UDLR</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save slot selection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UDLR</li>
<li>R1</li>
<li>L1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<br />
The fact that inputs can be doubled by the press of keys other than
those in the list for single inputs or repeatable inputs highlight
further that this is a bug.
</p>

<p>
For example in all three of these menus, inputs can be doubled by
every key not included in the single inputs and repeatable inputs
list. What business do these keys have taking effect on inputs in
these menus when there is no code to use them in these contexts.
</p>

<p>
Keys that can repeat are all those in the repeatable keys logic
list. And all those that can trigger them is every key.

</p>

<p>
So what we have seen so far and some objective and subjective
babbling&#x2026;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
When any input is cleared for processing in menus it ultimately is
done so by testing eax and processing if eax is not 0.
</p>

<p>
Seen following calls to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>B74 - "check if key in 'recent keys'(E0)" (for single inputs)</li>
<li>3F1 - simple wrapper</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also see other functions perform the eax test and their own
additional checks/actions before sending the result up the chain to
the calling function(s):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3B2 - UDLR</li>
<li>099 - check for repeatable key function (oh we'll get to you)</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
34, the repeat is active flag, is set and never checked.
</p>

<p>
And its value changes perfectly line up with when the 200ms delay
should be respected.
</p></li>

<li><p>
2C, what I call the repeat gate flag, not because of when it gets
set, like why I call 34 what I do. But because of the one and only
place it is checked. In 099.
</p>

<p>
If forced to be only ever 1, repeat is constant and immediate. It
is what keeps repeat firing on 50ms ticks, it is what keeps it from
firing before the 200ms wait has passed. It gates repeat from
occurring.
</p>

<p>
Im of the firm belief that the only reason it is 1 when a value is
found in E0 is because they janked up implementing the repeat
feature and creating double input was the solution. It not being
assigned 1 in 108 when E0 is occupied, without first finishing the
implementation, means no input for repeatable keys until after
200ms.
</p>

<p>
A band aid slapped in place because of time constraints or rotating
someone off the job before it was finished or both. Or whatever.
</p></li>

<li><p>
099, the place all roads lead to (other than B67) when parsing
repeatable keys, is only ever used in menus and has an unreachable
condition and only ever pulls from D4 (all held keys).
</p>

<p>
I'll say, though I may need to do more work explaining it, that
clearly it should be pulling from E0 (keys this frame) if/when
there is a value in it. Keys never have any business repeating when
E0 is occupied.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the fix uses the 34 flag, but E0 would accomplish the same
thing, 34 doesn't need to exist, 2C will do the rest of the job
just fine. But it does&#x2026; so why not use it. Its faster than using
E0 thanks to the skipped unnecessary test and dumb extra xor. Which
is likely 34's purpose. Guiding to a condition where unnecessary
code does not take place. There is no point in checking for the next
tick of repeat while delay is in 'current wait'.

<p>
For right after the intros the origins of those values are dwords in
the stack at 011D5104 (200) and 011D5108 (50) and they get there here
just prior to calling the function.
</p>

<p>
This is a list of places that function gets called from (or is even at
all referenced), and exactly like above, 50 and 200 get put in the
stack just prior to calling, never 0 for either value.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that there are other calls that are done with relative
pointers, but I haven't found them. And as best as I can tell, this
function is used to set these values every time an menu module is
loaded. If their are menu inputs to handle, this function is run
before preparing to do so.
</p>

<p>
Checking the process memory the moment it spawns, shows that those
values are in place after a fraction of a second. So there is a window
of time when the process starts when they, or most importantly E4
(rate &#x2026; 50) is 0. It is very small. Sending the game inputs in that
window of time would take effort but is not impossible. Whether it is
capable of receiving or processing inputs at this time is another
question.
</p>

<p>
The moment a menu scene/module is loaded, the timing assignment
function is called.  So code in those modules checking for rate to be
0 is, dumb. Assuming the above function is never used to set the rate
var to 0 with relative pointers that I missed. And assuming I am
correct about the zeroing function below.

<b>Nowhere in the code is this function ever explicitly referenced, at
all. Neither as value or pointer.</b>
</p>

<p>
Like the rate and delay assignment function there is the possibility
that there are calls to this function using relative pointers, but I
cant find this function executing at all with breakpoints, in menus or
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
As best as I can tell this code is never reached, and at least is
never reached during menus. When it could have had some effect on the
repeat processing. Though double input would still exist and
repeatable inputs would be insane&#x2026;. its a tick rate of 0. See my mod
for what that would be like.

When we compare condition 1 to condition 2, we see they are quite
similar.
</p>

<p>
Condition 1, unreachable.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both load the key value from the stack.</li>
<li>Both push it to the top of the stack.</li>
<li>Both call B67.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Condition 2:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Checks if the key was found (the 'test eax,eax').</li>
<li>Then moves the repeat gate flag into eax if it was.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We now have all the pieces.
</p>

<p>
We know that DI is not intentional, there is no code for handling keys
that can trigger repeat in certain menus, like Up &gt; Triangle in New
Game/Continue menu, seriously&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Their is an unused flag, perfectly in sync with when the 200ms wait
should be respected.
</p>

<p>
The conditional in 099 (cmp dword ptr [009A85E4],00) is nonsense,
checking if E4 is 0, when it only ever gets set to 50 every, single,
time, you enter a menu.
</p>

<p>
We have the facility to pull inputs from E0 (keys this frame).
</p>

<p>
We know that from 099 all we need to do is pass a 0 or non zero in eax
up the chain of calling functions depending on if a key is found and
should be played in game.
</p>

<p>
We know that in this unique place (099) where the repeat features
timing(2C) is kept in sync with keys getting processed when
found.
</p>

<p>
There is a condition that does not get reached that simply calls a
function to check if the key is pressed and then leaves ignoring 2C.
</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2C%20-%20repeat%20gate" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="2C%20-%20repeat%20gate">2C - repeat gate</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2C%20-%20repeat%20gate">
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
As I've already covered the repeat gate being set while E0 is occupied
makes little to no sense logically, other than to overcome an
incomplete implementation of input repeat in menus. And this is the
only place it is ever read from(loaded).
</p>

<p>
So for the sake of argument lets assume it is only set in 1 scenario,
rather than 2. That scenario being the second of its two scenarios
mentioned at the beginning of this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E0 (keys this frame) holds no value, 0.</li>
<li>D4 (all held keys) holds a value greater than 0.</li>
<li>The timer not less than the 'current wait'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we have no inputs from repeatable keys until 200ms have
passed while the button(s) are held. But DI still exists.
</p>

<p>
Lets stick a pin in that.
</p>

<p>
<br />
<br />

<div id="outline-container-cmp%20dword%20ptr%20%5B009A85E4%5D%2C00%20-%20Condition%201%27s%20unyielding%20gatekeeper" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="cmp%20dword%20ptr%20%5B009A85E4%5D%2C00%20-%20Condition%201%27s%20unyielding%20gatekeeper">cmp dword ptr [009A85E4],00 - Condition 1's unyielding gatekeeper</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-cmp%20dword%20ptr%20%5B009A85E4%5D%2C00%20-%20Condition%201%27s%20unyielding%20gatekeeper">
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
This fella makes no sense, so lets give it a purpose.
</p>

<p>
Now it checks the repeat is active flag (34).
</p>

<p>
And for thought experimentation purposes lets just say that condition
one is blank (nop'ed). Does nothing, just jumps to the end of the
function.
</p>

<p>
Now we have no inputs from repeatable keys until 200ms have passed
while the button(s) are held. AND DI is gone, cant happen, period.
</p>

<p>
This is even if 2C is permitted to be 1 when E0 is occupied. It is now
never loaded by 099 when E0 is occupied, or while the 200ms delay is
active. It does not matter while 34 is 0.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Now%20lets%20look%20at%20condition%201.">
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
Its effectively 3F1. It:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Makes a simple call to B67 (check if in 'all keys'(D4))</li>
<li>Receives the result</li>
<li>Pass it up the chain to the calling function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
2C does not matter to it.
</p>

<p>
If its call is to B74 (check if key in 'recent keys'(E0)) instead of
B67 (check if in 'all keys'(D4)).
</p>

<p>
And if we change that gatekeeper to check repeat is active flag (34).
</p>

<p>
There is now inputs on key press for repeatable keys, double input is
gone. Repeat after 200ms works like normal, as it should. And there
are no undesirable effects. The DI fix.

2C is of no consequence, so it is ignored and allowed to go on being

Reading over everything I realised I never explained exceptions #2. I
don't recall if there are other examples but in battles the start
button cant trigger DI. Also in battles, when the cursor is on a menu
(not on a character or enemy), Square does not trigger DI.
</p>

<p>
This is because they either pause the game and thus prevent the
processing of inputs, DI or otherwise. Or in the case of square,
removes the menu, preventing processing of inputs, DI or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Maybe not an extensive list of examples of this type of exception. But
all I can remember right now. Might work this section into the flow of
this doc in a version 2.

<p>
It should be very obvious how to go about detecting cheaters if
concerned. Enforce input overlays and/or controller cams, and if a vod
is suspected to have the fix applied, watch for DI where there should
be DI. Rip vods, watch in slow motion. It is very detectable as long
as the run benefited from the fix and even when it doesn't, its just a
case of spotting it. And if it was used but the run did not benefit
from it, it honestly doesn't matter now does it.
</p>

<p>
Hiding the use of di-fix will require such meticulous razor thin edits
in parts of the vods where menuing is taking place to hide visual and
audio ques of inputs that it honestly would be simpler to just splice
in a whole menuing segment perfectly executed and changing the HP, MP,
XP, AP, etc values. Which is its own problem I imagine. From where I'm
sitting, if someone wanted to cheat and hide it, there are paths of
less resistance with better benefits than using the di-fix.
</p>

<p>
These two clips (thank you zeg), while not a benefit per se because
they are of a technique that relies on double input but causes delays
ordinarily. Once the input overlay is understood its clear that a
doubled circle would have occurred when the arrow is pressed.
</p>

<p>
When pressing left to cursor over 'Change':
</p>
<video width="400" controls loop>
  <source src="change.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>
Before the first command is fully confirmed:
</p>

<video width="400" controls loop>
  <source src="grenade.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>
So di-fix during an active repeat feature is very noticeable and
probably undesirable in the case of this technique.
</p>

<p>
I can expand this section later if people ask. But I expect that those
that read through this doc and have a vested interest in keeping
cheaters out of the speed running community, already have tools and
methods for analysis that they are familiar with. Leveraging those
methods to detect DI fix where no DI fix is allowed should be trivial
to them.
</p>

<p>
But I am always available for questions in case I failed to fully paint
the picture in a way such methods require.
